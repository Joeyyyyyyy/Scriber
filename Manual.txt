Using Scriber:

1. File Management: Opening and Saving Files
Open File: Access the file menu and choose "Open" to load a .txt file into the editor.
Save File: Use the "Save" option from the file menu or press Ctrl + S to save your work. 
If no file is currently open, you will be prompted to save as a new file.
Backup Save: Files are securely backed up in a designated directory with a timestamped filename.

2. Auto-Save
This feature saves your work automatically in the background to prevent data loss. 
You do not need to manually trigger this, but always save your work before closing.

3. Pause-Resume Feature
Press the Pause button to halt time tracking (useful during breaks). The button changes to Resume.
When resumed, the program calculates and adjusts the total time lost during the pause and reflects it in your timestamps.

4. Setting Event Start Time
Click the Start Time button on the toolbar to set a starting time. By default, it is set to 2:30pm.
You can modify the starting time and the elapsed time will be calculated based on the difference from this point.

5. Text Editing and Formatting
Insert Default Text: The app starts with default content containing event details and timestamp examples. This can be edited as needed.
Headings and Timestamps: Automatically formatted with asterisks for easy identification.
Brackets Replacement: Type () in your text, and the program will replace it with the current timestamp and elapsed time.

6. Mentions and Tags
Use the Mentions dropdown to insert predefined text for trainers or delegates.
Use the Tags dropdown to insert session activities or event markers such as "Break," "Exercise," or "Story."

7. Word Checker
Activate the Word Checker using the file menu or Ctrl + W. This feature highlights American English words from a predefined list.
Re-enable or disable this by clicking the "Word Checker" option in the menu.

8.ProofReader
Reads the entire document and alerts the user if there are repeated timestamps or ones with incorrect formatting.

9.Export to Word
Converts the file into Rich Text Format, removes asterisks and boldens the text that was surrounded by asterisks. 
After performing these tasks, the text is copied to the device's clipboard.

10. Undo Feature
If you make a mistake, you can undo your last action with Ctrl + Z.

11. Custom Context Menu
Right-click anywhere in the text area to bring up a context menu for:
Copy: Copy selected text.
Cut: Cut selected text.
Paste: Paste from the clipboard.

12. Exit Confirmation
Before closing the application, you will be prompted to save your work. This ensures no progress is lost accidentally.

13. Generate Report
This advanced feature gets an extensive report on the event ready with the click of a button. 
However, it is very important that VLC format is followed in the Timestamps for this feature to work perfectly.

14. Import from Word
This feature allows the user to extract text data from a docx file. 
Two files are created: One is in UTF-8 format and the other is in cp1252 format.
UTF-8 will preserve data perfectly while cp1252 might not. 
However, Scriber can only read data in cp-1252 and hence that is the file that gets opened.
Both the files will be saved in the same directory as the original docx file.

Advanced Features

1. Time Lost Calculation
You can also manually input the time lost during breaks by selecting Time Lost from the file menu if you didn't use the pause button properly.
The program will adjust the timestamp calculations based on the input, ensuring accurate session tracking.

2. Replace Brackets with Time
If you type () in the text area, it will automatically be replaced with the current time in *HH:MM AM/PM* (elapsed time) format.
