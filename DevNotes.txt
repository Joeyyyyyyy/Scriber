Developer Notes

Application Name: Scriber

Welcome to the Comprehensive Documentation for the Scriber Application.

This software is designed specifically for enhancing the efficiency of video documentation during seminars and sessions. Its primary aim is to streamline the documentation process by automating time-stamping, allowing users to concentrate fully on content rather than monitoring the clock. By eliminating the need to constantly check the time, the application reduces distractions and minimizes the risk of human error in timestamp recording.

Scriber automatically generates timestamps, sequence tags, and mentions according to a pre-defined format, thereby saving users from extensive formatting tasks. This makes it an ideal tool for those seeking to achieve meticulous and precise documentation of live events.

Known Limitations:

- Copy-pasting large chunks of text containing the string '()' might cause unexpected behavior.
- Performance may degrade when handling very large text files, particularly those exceeding 5MB in size, which could potentially lead to lag or freezing. However, this won't happen since we will not be dealing with such enormous text files for the intended purposes.

---

Optimal Performance Guidelines:

- Small Files (up to 100KB): The application runs seamlessly with small files, providing a smooth and responsive user experience. Ideal for short texts, notes, and quick edits without any performance concerns.
- Medium Files (100KB to 1MB): The application handles medium-sized files efficiently, with minimal lag during operations. Suitable for standard documents and code files, maintaining good performance for most typical use cases.
- Large Files (1MB to 5MB): While performance may slightly decrease, the application remains highly functional for larger text files. Users can expect reasonable responsiveness, making it well-suited for extensive notes and detailed documents.
- Very Large Files (over 5MB): The application is designed to manage large files with improved efficiency, though performance may vary depending on the size. Users can still work with substantial text volumes, though they may experience some lag during intensive operations.
- Text Manipulation: The application's text handling capabilities are robust, even with large-scale text replacements and edits. While performance might slow with extremely large data, the core functionality remains effective for comprehensive text management.
- Scrolling and Navigation: The application maintains good performance with file scrolling and navigation, even with sizable text content. Users will find the interface responsive and capable of handling extensive document navigation smoothly.
